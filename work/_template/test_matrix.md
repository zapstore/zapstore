- edge cases
- failure modes

Do not list:

- trivial happy paths only
- tests that merely mirror the implementation

## Behavioral Coverage

| Scenario | Expected Behavior | Test Type | Location |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------- | -------- |
|          |                   |           |          |

## Notes

- Prefer fewer, high-signal tests over broad but shallow coverage.
- If a scenario is intentionally untested, state why.
