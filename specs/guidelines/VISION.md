# Zapstore — Vision

## What Zapstore Is
Zapstore is a local-first, Nostr-native app distribution platform focused on trust,
verification, and user sovereignty.

It enables discovering, installing, and supporting apps using open protocols
(Nostr + Bitcoin/Lightning), without centralized app store control.

## Who It Is For
- Users who value open networks and self-custody
- Developers distributing apps via Nostr
- Communities curating and funding software directly

## What Success Means
- Users can reliably discover and install apps offline-first
- Installs and updates are verifiable and safe
- Developers can be supported directly via zaps

## Non-Goals
- Zapstore is not a general-purpose app marketplace
- Zapstore does not optimize for engagement or growth metrics
- Zapstore does not require real-world identity or accounts
- Zapstore does not hide trust, verification, or provenance from users
