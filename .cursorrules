# Zapstore — Cursor Rules

Source of truth:
- specs/guidelines/CONTEXT.md (orientation only)
- specs/guidelines/VISION.md
- specs/guidelines/ARCHITECTURE.md
- specs/guidelines/INVARIANTS.md
- specs/guidelines/QUALITY_BAR.md

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT edit files under specs/guidelines unless explicitly instructed by a human.
- If specs are unclear or contradictory, STOP and report a "Spec Issue". Do not guess.

Working rules:
- Prefer small, localized changes. Avoid unrelated refactors.
- After dependency changes, run: fvm flutter pub get
- Fix any analyze/lint errors introduced by your changes.
- Do not use polling or artificial Future.delayed; await Futures/Streams correctly.
- Keep lib/widgets/common generic and reusable.
- Assume Android as default target unless instructed otherwise.
